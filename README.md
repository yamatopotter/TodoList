# TodoList
A simple ToDo List with HTML, SASS &amp; JS

This project uses the famous *animate.css* to add some cool animation during adding things to do. It shoud not be used to make a to do list because it doesn't save anywhere, so a simple refresh could clean your list and make you angry or upset.

This was used to study simple JS functions, a little bit of css.

So, have fun!
